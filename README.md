# Extremweather predictions

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary


Extreme weather has become more normal in times of climate change. Nevertheless, these weather conditions can have devastating consequences for the regions. A forecast by AI could give the respective regions a chance to prepare for these weather conditions


## Background

Unpredictable weather conditions can cause a lot of damage to infrastructure and people. One of the most recent events would be the flood disaster in the ahr valley.

Extreme weather paralyzes transport networks, causes power outages and disrupts energy and water supplies. The population is being cut off from essential goods and services â€“ from food to medical care. In the worst case, extreme weather can even cost lives. And: Extreme weather events represent one of the greatest dangers for the failure of our critical infrastructure (KRITIS). Without functioning critical infrastructure, safe life as we know it is no longer possible. Population, state institutions, emergency organizations: Everyone is affected by climate change


## Data sources and AI methods
Predicting extreme weather is difficult. Not only are there many different types of extreme weather, but many factors play into the formation of these weather patterns. Potential data for the Ai would be:
* Dry periods - How did dry periods change over time and what could it mean for the future
* Rainfall - Can we expect more or less rain in this region
* Rising levels of rivers - is it possible that the rivers could overflow
* Temperature - how extrem can the temperatures become

The goal is simple, what is a probability of Extremweather in the future for a particular region. We can treat each data source listed above as single neuron and apply different AI method to it. If enough neurons show high probability of changing weather, then we have a potential candidate for a city that will encounter a  crisis in the future. We can also apply different importance value to each neuron. For example, low rainfall and high temperature might look like , a future dry period and bad news for a city but they might be already aware and have advance research on desalination.

Odds and probability are going to be important subjects in this project. We will have to do our best to predict future dry periods, rainfalls and water consumption. Looking at past Extremweather around the word might provide valuable insights. 
The flooding of the Ahr-valley was a period of extrem Rainfall and grounds that were already soaked from the rain during the day.
